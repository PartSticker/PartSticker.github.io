        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Design prototyping involves creating mockups of products or concepts to gather feedback and iterate on ideas. 
            While prototyping often requires specific parts of objects, such as when constructing a novel creature for a video 
            game, existing text-to-image methods tend to only generate entire objects. To address this, we propose a novel task 
            and method of ``part sticker generation", which entails generating an isolated part of an object on a neutral background. 
            Experiments demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with respect to realism and text alignment, 
            while preserving object-level generation capabilities.

        <h2>Approach</h2>

        <p>We design a pipeline to support our task of part sticker generation, by generating a single part specified in a 
            text prompt that is `pasted' on a neutral, gray background. The pipeline consists of two key steps.  
            First, given an image with associated object and part segmentation masks, we localize each desired part and place it in the center of a gray background. 
            Second, for each localized image region, we pair it with a prompt describing the region.  All resulting image-prompt 
            pairs are then used to train a text-to-image diffusion model.  We hypothesize that such a pipeline would enable a 
            trained model to generate diverse renderings for each part type because existing datasets offer many diverse part segmentations, 
            including of the same types observed across different objects (e.g., an eye can be found in a frog and dog).

            Qualitative results showing examples of generated images given text prompts (left) and the average image of 100 generated samples 
            from a given method (left). Overall, we observe that PartStickers is the only method capable of consistently generating only the requested 
            part on a neutral background with a high degree of realism. The bottom three rows represent out-of-distribution scenarios for PartStickers: 
            generation of an object and two out-of-distribution parts. (SD stands for Stable Diffusion).
